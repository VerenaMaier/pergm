The R package allows to simulate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM)
in parallel. Used network statistics (number of edges, 2-stars and triangles) 
induce a conditional independence structure amongst the edges of the network.
A log transformation can be used as well. The log transformation provides 
a concave function such that linearity and degeneracy problems diminishes.
The algorithm is implemented in C++ and the parallelization works in C++ 
via OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing).
