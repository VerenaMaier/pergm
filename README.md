The R package allows to simulate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) in parallel. For simulating networks in parallel we start a single Markov chain simulation but apply parallel computing for each single step of the Markov chain. The central idea is to take advantage of the conditional independence structure and simulate multiple conditionally independent edges in networks simultaneously in parallel. A log transformation can be used as well. The log transformation provides a concave function such that linearity and degeneracy problems diminishes. The algorithm is implemented in C++ and the parallelization works in C++ via OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing).
